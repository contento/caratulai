# Contributing to caratulai

Thanks for your interest! caratulai is an alien image generator — concepts to simple vector images
in fundamental palettes. Before contributing, skim [README.md](README.md) and [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)
to absorb the aesthetic; it is enforced, not optional.

## Development setup

Requires Node ≥ 20 and pnpm (`corepack enable pnpm`).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build        # build all packages
pnpm typecheck    # type-check without emitting

# run the CLI
node packages/cli/dist/index.js palettes
node packages/cli/dist/index.js generate star water travel --palette sepia --out out/idea.svg

# generate visual samples for all profiles (requires LLM provider)
pnpm samples:live
```

## Project layout

- `packages/core` — the engine (ontology, palettes, prompt builder, providers, SVG validator).
  Stays I/O-agnostic: no direct DB/filesystem here.
- `packages/cli` — command-line interface over the engine.
## Conventions

- **Commits:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — `feat:`, `fix:`,
  `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`. Keep them small and focused.
- **Code:** ESM TypeScript, `@caratulai/<name>` scope. Match the surrounding style.
- **Aesthetic:** any change to generation must keep output passing the validator — fundamental
  palettes only, simple primitives, little/no text. See the guardrails in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
- **Composition:** each profile's `composition` field in `profiles.ts` shapes spatial arrangement.
  When adding or tuning a profile, include composition guidance that matches its aesthetic philosophy.
  Test with `pnpm samples:live` to verify visual output.
- **Decisions:** record non-obvious choices as short ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.

## Pull requests

1. Branch off `main`.
2. Make sure `pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck` pass.
3. Open a PR describing the change and linking any related issue.

## Releases

Releases are tag-driven: pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers the release workflow, which builds and
publishes a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.
